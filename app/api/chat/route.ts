Look for fragrances with aquatic or marine notes for that clean, refreshing feel. Some excellent options include Acqua di Gio by Giorgio Armani, which features lime and sea notes, or Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana with its Sicilian lemon opening. These fragrances typically have moderate longevity (4-6 hours) and are perfect for daytime wear.";

These often feature expensive materials like natural oud, ambergris, or Bulgarian rose absolute. For example, Baccarat Rouge 540 uses saffron and amberwood for its distinctive character. Luxury fragrances typically offer superior longevity (8+ hours) and complexity that evolves beautifully throughout the day. The investment is worthwhile for special occasions or as a signature scent.";

Tom Ford Black Orchid combines dark chocolate and patchouli for mysterious allure, while Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium offers coffee and vanilla for sweet seduction. Apply to pulse points 30 minutes before your date to allow proper development. These fragrances work best in evening settings and cooler weather.";

Consider your lifestyle - are you looking for office-appropriate scents, weekend casuals, or evening glamour? Our Scent Builder tool can help you experiment with different combinations. I recommend starting with 2-3 note families you love, then building complexity from there. What type of mood or impression do you want your signature scent to convey?";
